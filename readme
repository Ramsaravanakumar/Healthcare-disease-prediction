## 📊 Dataset

- **Samples**: 768
- **Features**:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age
- **Target**: `Outcome` (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)

## 🔑 Feature Insights (from Correlation Matrix)

- **Glucose** has the highest correlation with disease (`0.49`)
- Other significant features:
  - **BMI** (`0.31`)
  - **Age** (`0.24`)
  - **Pregnancies** (`0.22`)
- Visualized using a heatmap to guide feature selection

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: `78.6%`
- **Confusion Matrix**:
- **Classification Report**:
- **Precision (Class 1)**: `0.72`
- **Recall (Class 1)**: `0.63`
